						<h3>I'm a psycholinguist interested in what linguistic meanings are, how they're acquired, and how they relate to non-linguistic cognitive systems.</h3>
					</header>

					<p> Understanding an expression like <i>every frog is green</i> or <i>most dogs are friendly</i> requires building some sort of mental representation. 
						I'm interested in what those representations look like.  
						In particular, what logical primitives (e.g., individuals; groups; relations; negation) are implicated?  
						What consequences does the answer to that question have for the relationship between linguistic meanings and non-linguistic thought? 
						And how does it matter for theories of how meanings get acquired by children? 
						To get at these questions, I've used a range of methods including: 
						psychophysical experiments with adults, 
						artificial language learning experiments with children, 
						habituation experiments with infants, 
						analysis of naturally-occurring speech data, 
						and good old linguistic intuitions.
						<!--I've largely focused on the meanings of quantificational expressions in English (<i>each</i>; <i>every</i>; <i>most</i>), 
						but have also worked on superlatives and verbs. -->

					<p><h3>Universal Quantifiers:</h3> 
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/FirstSecondOrderStim.png" alt="" /></span>
						A sentence like <i>every circle is blue</i> could be mentally represented as (i) a relation between two independent groups (<i>the circles are among the blue things</i>), (ii) a non-relational description of how the predicate applies to the members of one group (<i>"is blue" applies exhaustively to the circles</i>), or (iii) in a completely first-order way that implicates no groups at all (<i>each thing that’s a circle is blue</i>). Logically, these descriptions are equivalent. But psychologically, they correspond to distinct hypotheses about speakers’ mental lives.

						To tease them apart, my collaborators and I ask how well adults and kids remember individual properties (a specific circle’s color) versus group properties (approximate cardinality; center of mass) after evaluating sentences with <i>each</i> or <i>every</i>. We find that given sentences like <i>every circle is blue</i>, participants recall group properties for the circles, but not for the blue things or even the blue circles. And if <i>each</i> is substituted for <i>every</i>, they recall no group properties at all. This suggests that <i>each</i> has a meaning like (iii) while <i>every</i> has a meaning like (ii). We argue that these representations have consequences for our understanding of the semantic universal “conservativity” and of the ways in which parents use these quantifiers in speech to children. 
					</p>

				<p><h3>Precursors of Quantification in Infancy:</h3> 
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/chevronsStim.png" alt="" /></span>
					When do infants have access to quantificational concepts, like those underlying <i>each</i> and <i>all</i>? So far, we’ve found that even 10 month-olds distinguish collective and distributive exhaustive actions. In particular, they treat videos of three chevrons chasing a single ball together as different in kind from perceptually similar videos in which three chevrons each individually chase their own ball. Follow-up experiments are underway to control for low-level perceptual differences (e.g., spatial dispersion) and to relate these findings to the working memory literature: if infants treat the agents of chasing as a single group in the collective videos, there should be no limit to the number of chevrons they can represent; if they treat the agents of chasing as individuals in the distributive videos, their working memory should become overloaded as more chevrons are added. We’ve also started looking for evidence that infants have access to other quantificational concepts (e.g., can they learn monotonic and antitonic functions?) 
				</p>

				<p><h3>Majority Quantifiers:</h3>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/moreMostStim.png" alt="" /></span> 
					In a picture with 8 yellow dots and 12 blue dots, both of these sentences are true: <br> (1) most of the dots are blue. <br> (2) more of the dots are blue. <br> But while (1) calls for comparing the number of blue dots to the total number of dots, (2) calls for comparing the blue and yellow dots directly. My collaborators and I argue that these subtle differences in meaning influence how adults and children expect visual scenes to look (e.g., given (1), they create pictures like A but given (2), they create pictures like B), what information they remember from those scenes (they encode only the set of blue dots given (1) but encode both blue and yellow given (2)), and how easily they are able to judge the sentence as true (evaluating (2) is easier, since direct comparisons introduce less noise than proportional comparisons). Together, these effects demonstrate that <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> have discoverable decompositional mental representations that are (at least largely) shared across speakers of English at a fine-grained level of representational detail. We've recently started to extend these predictions to Cantonese majority quantifiers as well. 
				</p> 

				<p><h3>Event Concepts & Syntactic Bootstrapping:</h3>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/3rdManStim.png" alt="" /></span>
					Learners use the syntactic context of a word to help narrow down their hypothesis space about its meaning. For example, they relate syntactic arguments and event participants in verb learning. But what is the nature of this relation? Do they expect the number of participants perceived in an event to match one-to-one the number of arguments in the clause describing that event? Or do they exploit knowledge of more sophisticated relationships and expect that particular argument positions will name certain participant roles? To this end, we’ve identified events -- like <i>a girl taking a truck from a boy</i> -- that infants plausibly view under a 3-participant concept but that adults often describe with transitive clauses like "The girl took the truck" (without mentioning from whom). We’re using these videos to test how young learners' hypotheses about novel verb meanings change depending on the syntactic frame in which they’re presented.

						</summary>
							<p> 
								This textbook introduces fundamental concepts and results in the theory of first 
								language acquisition, bringing together linguistic phenomena on the one hand and
								learning and cognitive development on the other. Grammar and development are 
								woven together through a range of case studies that provide students with the tools 
								to think about (a) what is already understood about language acquisition; (b) what 
								methods we use to identity children's grammatical knowledge; and (c) how to 
								approach problems in any area of grammatical acquisition. 
								Each of the book's five parts illustrates a foundational concept in the theory of 
								language and its acquisition: the nature of learning in the biological world; categories 
								in phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax; hierarchical structure; grammatical 
								dependencies; and the role of information processing systems in the theory of 
								language acquisition. Designed with advanced undergraduate and beginning 
								graduate students in mind, the book includes discussion questions and suggestions 
								for further reading at the end of each chapter.

							<i>Language shifts the representation of auditory objects</i>.&nbsp
						</summary>
							<p> Humans have the ability to represent objects as individuals or as members of a group. 
								Subtle changes in linguistic framing – such as describing a scene in terms of “each object” 
								versus “every object” – have been shown to shift which representational system gets deployed. 
								Namely, the same visually presented objects are more likely to be treated as a series of 
								independent object-files when described with “each” and as a single ensemble collection when 
								described with “every”. But it’s unclear whether the same sort of representational shift can 
								occur in the auditory domain, where information is fleeting and presented sequentially instead 
								of in parallel. We explored this question by asking how well participants could recall individual- 
								and group-based properties of auditory tones depending on the way those tones were described 
								(as “each sound” or “every sound”). We find that these two quantificational words had distinct 
								effects on performance: Observers were better in an individuation task when the tones were 
								described as “each sound”, and were independently better in an ensemble averaging task when the 
								tones were described as “every sound”. This suggests that, as for visual objects, subtle 
								differences in linguistic framing can influence the system used to represent auditory objects. </p>

							<i>Non-conservative quantifiers are unlernable</i>.&nbsp
						</summary>
							<p> Linguistic universals have long been a cornerstone of linguistic theories. 
								Perhaps the most well-known universal in the semantic domain is the observation that all 
								quantificational determiners (e.g., “every”, “some”, “no”) have 'conservative' meanings: 
								only the noun phrase with which the quantifier combines matters for the truth of the sentence. 
								If it's true that “every fish swims” then it's true that “every fish is a fish that swims” 
								(<i>cf</i>. “only fish swim”, which is not true in all the same situations as “only fish are 
								fish that swim”). Accordingly, no language has a 'non-conservative' quantifier like “equi”, 
								where “equi fish swims” means “the fish and the swimmers are numerically equivalent” 
								(this quantifier fails to be conservative because the swimmers also matter). This robust 
								cross-linguistic generalization has been argued to reflect a fundamental property of quantifier 
								semantics, a linguistically-specific constraint. If conservativity is a genuine semantic universal, 
								as opposed to the result of a historical accident, then non-conservative quantifiers should be 
								unlearnable. Across seven experiments, we show that this prediction is borne out. Adult 
								participants fail to learn three novel non-conservative meanings, even when explicitly taught, 
								but succeed at learning their conservative counterparts. And since conservativity is a property 
								of <i>quantifier</i> semantics, this effect disappears when an intended non-conservative meaning 
								is instead paired with verbal syntax. These results suggest that the conservativity universal is 
								tied to learnability, and support semantic theories on which conservativity reflects a deep fact 
								about the human language faculty. </p>

						</summary>
							<p>One of the best-known semantic universals is determiner conservativity, roughly, the idea that 
								the truth of sentences like <i>most fish swim</i> depends only on the things named by the 
								determiner's first argument (<i>fish</i>). Conservativity has been argued to reflect a fundamental 
								property of grammatical architecture, a conclusion bolstered by evidence that adults (and children) 
								can pair novel determiners with conservative meanings but not with minimally-different 
								non-conservative meanings. Here we extend this work to 'weakly' conservative meanings 
								(ones for which the truth of the quantificational sentence depends either on the determiner's 
								first argument or on its second argument). Such meanings are classically non-conservative but 
								would be permitted under a weakened version of the generalization, which was designed to 
								accommodate meanings like those of <i>only</i> and <i>even</i>. We find that adults cannot 
								learn these kinds of novel determiner meanings either. This result suggests that the classical 
								understanding of conservativity (on which 'weakly' conservative meanings are ruled out by virtue 
								of being non-conservative) better describes the constraint that learners embody. </p>

						</summary>
							<p> Children use correlations between the syntax of a clause and the meaning of its predicate to draw 
								inferences about word meanings. On one proposal, these inferences are underwritten by a structural 
								similarity between syntactic and semantic representations: learners expect that the number of 
								clause arguments exactly matches the number of participant roles in the event concept under which 
								its referent is viewed. We argue against this proposal, and in favor of a theory rooted in 
								syntactic and semantic contents— in mappings from syntactic positions to thematic relations. 
								We (i) provide evidence that infants view certain scenes under a concept with three participant 
								relations (a girl taking a truck from a boy), and (ii) show that toddlers do not expect these 
								representations to align numerically with clauses used to describe those scenes: they readily 
								accept two-argument descriptions ("she pimmed the truck!"). This argues against syntactic 
								bootstrapping theories underwritten by mappings between structural features of syntactic and 
								semantic representations. Instead, our findings support bootstrapping based on grammatical and 
								thematic content. Children's earliest inferences may rely on the assumption that the syntactic 
								asymmetry between subject and object correlates with a difference in how their referents relate 
								to the event described by the sentence. </p>

								(the idea that topical quantifiers are Skolemized, resulting in the required x-y pairings) 
								(S.-Z. Huang 2022b). We argue that (a') pair-list answers to questions with quantifiers are 
								derivable from the Double Variable Hypothesis; (b') the subject/object asymmetry seen in 
								<i>every</i> is due to its positionally-varied association with the Double Variable Hypothesis,

    						<p> It's long been observed that <i>each</i> and <i>every</i>, while both distributive universal

								quantified over as a plurality; the representation that serves as the meaning of <i>each</i> 
								lacks any such piece. A natural prediction of this view is that <i>every NP</i> should implicitly 
								make available a plurality corresponding to "the NPs" in a way that <i>each NP</i> does not. We 
								test this prediction in two forced choice judgment experiments, both involving sentence-internal

							<p> The mind represents abstract magnitude information, including time, space, and number,

								In six experiments with college undergraduates, we show that observers are faster and more accurate 
								to find the endpoints (i.e., the minimum and maximum) than any of the inner values, even as the 
								number of items increases beyond visual short-term memory limits. Our results show that length, 
								size, and number are represented in a dynamic format that allows for comparison-free sorting, with 
								endpoints represented with an immediately accessible status, consistent with the bipartite model of 
								perceptual magnitudes. We discuss the implications for theories of visual search and ensemble

							<a href="pdfs/papers/KHPL2023.pdf" class="icon fa fa-file-pdf-o"></a>&nbsp
						</summary>
							<p> Though <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> are both distributive universal quantifiers, 
								a common theme in linguistic and psycholinguistic investigations into them has been that 
								<i>each</i> is somehow more individualistic than <i>every</i>. We offer a novel explanation for 
								this generalization: <i>each</i> has a first-order meaning which serves as an internalized 
								instruction to cognition to build a thought that calls for representing the (restricted) domain 
								as a series of individuals; by contrast, <i>every</i> has a second-order meaning which serves as 
								an instruction to build a thought that calls for grouping the domain. In support of this view, 
								we show that these distinct meanings invite the use of distinct verification strategies, using a 
								novel paradigm. In two experiments, participants who had been asked to verify sentences like 
								<i>each/every circle is green</i> were subsequently given a change detection task. Those who 
								evaluated <i>each</i>-sentences were better able to detect the change, suggesting they encoded the 
								individual circles' colors to a greater degree. Taken together with past work demonstrating that 
								participants recall group properties after evaluating sentences with <i>every</i> better than 
								after evaluating sentences with <i>each</i>, these results support the hypothesis that <i>each</i> 
								and <i>every</i> call for treating the individuals that constitute their domain differently: as 
								independent individuals (<i>each</i>) or as members of an ensemble collection (<i>every</i>). 
								We situate our findings within a conception of linguistic meanings as instructions for thought 
								building, on which the format of the resulting thought has consequences for how meanings interface

						</summary>
							<p> Quantificational determiners are often said to be devices for expressing relations. 
								For example, the meaning of <i>every</i> is standardly described as the inclusion relation, 
								with a sentence like <i>every frog is green</i> meaning roughly that the green things include the 
								frogs. Here, we consider an older, non-relational alternative: determiners are tools for creating 
								restricted quantifiers. On this view, determiners specify how many elements of a restricted domain 
								(e.g., the frogs) satisfy a given condition (e.g., being green). One important difference concerns 
								how the determiner treats its two grammatical arguments. On the relational view, the arguments are 
								on a logical par as independent terms that specify the two relata. But on the restricted view, 
								the arguments play distinct logical roles: specifying the limited domain versus supplying an 
								additional condition on domain entities. We present psycholinguistic evidence suggesting that the 
								restricted view better describes what speakers know when they know the meaning of a determiner. 
								In particular, we find that when asked to evaluate sentences of the form <i>every F is G</i>, 
								participants mentally group the Fs but not the Gs. Moreover, participants forego representing the 
								group defined by the intersection of F and G. This tells against the idea that speakers understand 
								<i>every F is G</i> as implying that the Fs bear relation (e.g., inclusion) to a second group. </p>

						</summary>
							<p> A complete theory of the meaning of linguistic expressions needs to explain their semantic properties, their links to non-linguistic cognition, and their use in communication. Even though in principle interconnected, these areas are generally not pursued in tandem. We present a novel take on the semantics-cognition-pragmatics interface. We propose that formal semantic differences in expressions’ meanings lead those meanings to activate distinct cognitive systems, which in turn have downstream effects on when speakers prefer to use those expressions. As a case study, we focus on the quantifiers "each" and "every", which can be used to talk about the same state of the world, but have been argued to differ in meaning. In particular, we adopt a mentalistic proposal about these quantifiers on which "each" has a purely individualistic meaning that interfaces with the psychological system for representing object-files, whereas "every" has a meaning that implicates a group and interfaces with the psychological system for representing ensembles. In seven experiments, we demonstrate that this account correctly predicts both known and newly-observed constraints on how "each" and "every" are pragmatically used. More generally, this integrated approach to semantics, cognition, and pragmatics suggests that canonical patterns of language use can be affected in predictable ways by fine-grained differences in semantic meanings and the cognitive systems to which those meanings connect. </p>

							<p> Objects can either be represented as independent individuals ("object-files") or as members of a collection (an "ensemble"). Work over the past 40 years has explored these representational systems, largely in the visual domain. Far less is known about auditory objects. Here, we show that a property characteristic of visual object representation – that it can be modulated by linguistic framing – also applies to auditory objects. In particular, we show that using the expression "each sound" versus "every sound" can bias auditory object construal in the same way that using "each circle" versus "every circle" can bias visual object construal. These findings support the idea that object-files and ensembles are not limited to the visual domain, but are representational formats found more generally throughout cognition. </p>

							<p> "Each" and "every" can be used to express the same truth-conditions but differ in their contexts of use. We adopt a particular psycho-semantic proposal about the meanings of these universal quantifiers: "each" has a meaning that interfaces with the psychological system for representing object-files whereas "every" has a meaning that interfaces with the psychological system for representing ensembles. In five experiments (n=798 total) we demonstrate that this mentalistic account correctly predicts newly-observed constraints on how "each" and "every" are pragmatically used. More generally, these results demonstrate that canonical patterns of language use are affected in predictable ways by fine-grained differences in semantic representations and the cognitive systems to which those representations connect. By treating the output of semantics as mental representations that are more finely articulated than truth-conditions -- and by taking seriously the relationship between linguistic meanings and non-linguistic cognitive systems -- we can explain otherwise puzzling patterns of language use. </p>

							<p> The universal quantifier <i>each</i> is more strongly distributive than its counterparts <i>every</i> and <i>all</i>. It forces predicates to apply to individuals, it more often supports pair-list readings, it’s unfriendly to genericity, and, in psycholinguistic tasks, it encourages encoding and remembering individual properties. But what information leads learners to acquire this aspect of <i>each</i>’s meaning? We explore the hypothesis that, because of its meaning, parents are more likely to use <i>each</i> in situations that independently promote representing the domain of quantification as a series of individuals (as opposed to a group). In line with this, we find that in child-directed speech, parents often use <i>each</i> to quantify over small numbers of physically present things. The same cannot be said of <i>every</i> and <i>all</i>. Because such situations are independently known to trigger object-files – the mind’s system for representing individuals – we argue that these cases are ideal for acquiring the individualistic aspect of <i>each</i>. </p>

							<p> A sentence like <i>every circle is blue</i> might be understood in terms of individuals and their properties (e.g., for each thing that is a circle, it is blue) or in terms of a relation between groups (e.g., the blue things include the circles). Relatedly, theorists can specify the contents of universally quantified sentences in first-order or second-order terms. We offer new evidence that this logical first-order vs. second-order distinction corresponds to a psychologically robust individual vs. group distinction that has behavioral repercussions. Participants were shown displays of dots and asked to evaluate sentences with <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, or <i>all</i> combined with a predicate (e.g., <i>big dot</i>). We find that participants are better at estimating how many things the predicate applied to after evaluating sentences in which universal quantification is indicated with <i>every</i> or <i>all</i>, as opposed to <i>each</i>. We argue that <i>every</i> and <i>all</i> are understood in second-order terms that encourage group representation, while <i>each</i> is understood in first-order terms that encourage individual representation. Since the sentences that participants evaluate are truth-conditionally equivalent, our results also bear on questions concerning how meanings are related to truth-conditions.

						</summary>
							<p> Natural languages like English connect pronunciations with meanings. Linguistic pronunciations can be described in ways that relate them to our motor system (e.g., to the movement of our lips and tongue). But how do linguistic meanings relate to our nonlinguistic cognitive systems? As a case study, we defend an explicit proposal about the meaning of <i>most</i> by comparing it to the closely related <i>more</i>: whereas <i>more</i> expresses a comparison between two independent subsets, <i>most</i> expresses a subset–superset comparison. Six experiments with adults and children demonstrate that these subtle differences between their meanings influence how participants organize and interrogate their visual world. In otherwise identical situations, changing the word from <i>most</i> to <i>more</i> affects preferences for picture–sentence matching (experiments 1–2), scene creation (experiments 3–4), memory for visual features (experiment 5), and accuracy on speeded truth judgments (experiment 6). These effects support the idea that the meanings of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> are mental representations that provide detailed instructions to conceptual systems.

							<p> Quantificational determiners have meanings that are "conservative" in the following sense: in sentences, repeating a determiner's internal argument within its external argument is logically insignificant. Using a verification task to probe which sets (or properties) of entities are represented when participants evaluate sentences, we test the predictions of three potential explanations for the cross-linguistic yet substantive conservativity constraint. According to "lexical restriction" views, words like <i>every</i> express relations that are exhibited by pairs of sets, but only some of these relations can be expressed with determiners. An "interface filtering" view retains the relational conception of determiner meanings, while replacing appeal to lexical filters (on relations of the relevant type) with special rules for interpreting the combination of a quantificational expression (Det NP) with its syntactic context and a ban on meanings that lead to triviality. The contrasting idea of "ordered predication" is that determiners don't express genuine relations. Instead, the second argument provides the scope of a monadic quantifier, while the first argument selects the domain for that quantifier: the sequences with respect to which it is evaluated. On this view, a determiner's two arguments each have a different logical status, suggesting that they might have a different psychological status as well. We find evidence that this is the case: When evaluating sentences like <i>every big circle is blue</i>, participants mentally group the things specified by the determiner's first argument (e.g., the big circles) but not the things specified by the second argument (e.g., the blue things) or the intersection of both (e.g., the big blue circles). These results suggest that the phenomenon of conservativity is due to ordered predication. </p>

							<p> A universally quantified sentence like <i>every frog is green</i> is standardly thought to express a two-place second-order relation (e.g., the set of frogs is a subset of the set of green things). This dissertation argues that as a psychological hypothesis about how speakers mentally represent universal quantifiers, this view is wrong in two respects. First, <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, and <i>all</i> are not represented as two-place relations, but as one-place descriptions of how a predicate applies to a restricted domain (e.g., relative to the frogs, everything is green). Second, while <i>every</i> and <i>all</i> are represented in a second-order way that implicates a group, <i>each</i> is represented in a completely first-order way that does not involve grouping the satisfiers of a predicate together (e.g., relative to individual frogs, each one is green). These "psycho-logical" distinctions have consequences for how participants evaluate sentences like <i>every circle is green</i> in controlled settings. In particular, participants represent the extension of the determiner’s internal argument (the circles), but not the extension of its external argument (the green things). Moreover, the cognitive system they use to represent the internal argument differs depending on the determiner: Given <i>every</i> or <i>all</i>, participants show signatures of forming ensemble representations, but given <i>each</i>, they represent individual object-files. In addition to psychosemantic evidence, the proposed representations provide explanations for at least two semantic phenomena. The first is the "conservativity" universal: All determiners allow for duplicating their first argument in their second argument without a change in informational significance (e.g., <i>every fish swims</i> has the same truth-conditions as <i>every fish is a fish that swims</i>). This is a puzzling generalization if determiners express two-place relations, but it is a logical consequence if they are devices for forming one-place restricted quantifiers. The second is that <i>every</i>, but not <i>each</i>, naturally invites certain kinds of generic interpretations (e.g., <i>gravity acts on every/#each object</i>). This asymmetry can potentially be explained by details of the interfacing cognitive systems (ensemble and object-file representations). And given that the difference leads to lower-level concomitants in child-ambient speech (as revealed by a corpus investigation), children may be able to leverage it to acquire <i>every</i>’s second-order meaning. This case study on the universal quantifiers suggests that knowing the meaning of a word like <i>every</i> consists not just in understanding the informational contribution that it makes, but in representing that contribution in a particular format. And much like phonological representations provide instructions to the motor planning system, it supports the idea that meaning representations provide (sometimes surprisingly precise) instructions to conceptual systems. </p>
