						<h2>Hi!</h2> 
						<h3>I'm a psycholinguist interested in natural language meaning, its acquisition, and how it interfaces with non-linguistic conceptual systems.</h3>
					</header>

					<p>My research largely focuses on the mental representations that serve as the meanings of quantificational expressions like <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, and <i>most</i>. 

					What are the formal properties of those representations? What implications do details of their representaitonal format have for how they make contact with other areas of cognition? And when/how do learners figure out how to pair these meaning representations with the right pronunciations? 

					To get at these questions, I’ve used a range of methods including behavioral experiments with adults, children, and infants, psychophysical modeling, corpus analysis, and good old linguistic intuitions. </p>

					<p>I'm currently a <a href="https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/">MindCORE</a> Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm working with <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/people/trueswell/">John Trueswell</a>, <a href="https://www.langcoglab.com/copy-of-people">Anna Papafragou</a>, and <a href="https://www.florianschwarz.net/">Florian Schwarz</a>.

					<p><h3>Universal Quantifiers:</h3> 
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/FirstSecondOrderStim.png" alt="" /></span>
						A sentence like <i>every circle is blue</i> could be mentally represented as (i) a relation between two independent groups (<i>the circles are among the blue things</i>), (ii) a non-relational description of how the predicate applies to the members of one group (<i>"is blue" applies exhaustively to the circles</i>), or (iii) in a completely first-order way that implicates no groups at all (<i>each thing that’s a circle is blue</i>). Logically, these descriptions are equivalent. But psychologically, they correspond to distinct hypotheses about speakers’ mental lives.

						To tease them apart, my collaborators and I ask how well adults and kids remember individual properties (a specific circle’s color) versus group properties (approximate cardinality; center of mass) after evaluating sentences with <i>each</i> or <i>every</i>. We find that given sentences like <i>every circle is blue</i>, participants recall group properties for the circles, but not for the blue things or even the blue circles. And if <i>each</i> is substituted for <i>every</i>, they recall no group properties at all. This suggests that <i>each</i> has a meaning like (iii) while <i>every</i> has a meaning like (ii). We argue that these representations have consequences for our understanding of the semantic universal “conservativity” and of the ways in which parents use these quantifiers in speech to children. 
					</p>

				<p><h3>Precursors of Quantification in Infancy:</h3> 
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/chevronsStim.png" alt="" /></span>
					When do infants have access to quantificational concepts, like those underlying <i>each</i> and <i>all</i>? So far, we’ve found that even 10 month-olds distinguish collective and distributive exhaustive actions. In particular, they treat videos of three chevrons chasing a single ball together as different in kind from perceptually similar videos in which three chevrons each individually chase their own ball. Follow-up experiments are underway to control for low-level perceptual differences (e.g., spatial dispersion) and to relate these findings to the working memory literature: if infants treat the agents of chasing as a single group in the collective videos, there should be no limit to the number of chevrons they can represent; if they treat the agents of chasing as individuals in the distributive videos, their working memory should become overloaded as more chevrons are added. We’ve also started looking for evidence that infants have access to other quantificational concepts (e.g., can they learn monotonic and antitonic functions?) 
				</p>

				<p><h3>Majority Quantifiers:</h3>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/moreMostStim.png" alt="" /></span> 
					In a picture with 8 yellow dots and 12 blue dots, both of these sentences are true: <br> (1) most of the dots are blue. <br> (2) more of the dots are blue. <br> But while (1) calls for comparing the number of blue dots to the total number of dots, (2) calls for comparing the blue and yellow dots directly. My collaborators and I argue that these subtle differences in meaning influence how adults and children expect visual scenes to look (e.g., given (1), they create pictures like A but given (2), they create pictures like B), what information they remember from those scenes (they encode only the set of blue dots given (1) but encode both blue and yellow given (2)), and how easily they are able to judge the sentence as true (evaluating (2) is easier, since direct comparisons introduce less noise than proportional comparisons). Together, these effects demonstrate that <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> have discoverable decompositional mental representations that are (at least largely) shared across speakers of English at a fine-grained level of representational detail. We've recently started to extend these predictions to Cantonese majority quantifiers as well. 
				</p> 

				<p><h3>Event Concepts & Syntactic Bootstrapping:</h3>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/3rdManStim.png" alt="" /></span>
					Learners use the syntactic context of a word to help narrow down their hypothesis space about its meaning. For example, they relate syntactic arguments and event participants in verb learning. But what is the nature of this relation? Do they expect the number of participants perceived in an event to match one-to-one the number of arguments in the clause describing that event? Or do they exploit knowledge of more sophisticated relationships and expect that particular argument positions will name certain participant roles? To this end, we’ve identified events -- like <i>a girl taking a truck from a boy</i> -- that infants plausibly view under a 3-participant concept but that adults often describe with transitive clauses like "The girl took the truck" (without mentioning from whom). We’re using these videos to test how young learners' hypotheses about novel verb meanings change depending on the syntactic frame in which they’re presented.

							<i>Non-conservative quantifiers are unlernable</i>.&nbsp
							<!--<a href="https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/006679" class="icon fa fa-link"></a>&nbsp-->
						</summary>
							<p> Linguistic universals have long been a cornerstone of linguistic theories. Perhaps the most well-known universal in the semantic domain is the observation that all quantificational determiners (e.g., “every”, “some”, “no”) have ‘conservative’ meanings: only the noun phrase with which the quantifier combines matters for the truth of the sentence. If it’s true that “every fish swims” then it’s true that “every fish is a fish that swims” (<i>cf</i>. “only fish swim”, which is not true in all the same situations as “only fish are fish that swim”). Accordingly, no language has a ‘non-conservative’ quantifier like “equi”, where “equi fish swims” means “the fish and the swimmers are numerically equivalent” (this quantifier fails to be conservative because the swimmers also matter). This robust cross-linguistic generalization has been argued to reflect a fundamental property of quantifier semantics, a linguistically-specific constraint. If conservativity is a genuine semantic universal, as opposed to the result of a historical accident, then non-conservative quantifiers should be unlearnable. Across seven experiments, we show that this prediction is borne out. Adult participants fail to learn three novel non-conservative meanings, even when explicitly taught, but succeed at learning their conservative counterparts. And since conservativity is a property of <i>quantifier</i> semantics, this effect disappears when an intended non-conservative meaning is instead paired with verbal syntax. These results suggest that the conservativity universal is tied to learnability, and support semantic theories on which conservativity reflects a deep fact about the human language faculty. </p>

							<i>Thematic content, not number matching, drives syntactic bootstrapping</i></a>.&nbsp
							<a href="pdfs/papers/PKWL2024.pdf" class="icon fa fa-file-pdf-o"></a>
						</summary>
							<p> Children use correlations between the syntax of a clause and the meaning of its predicate to draw inferences about word meanings. On one proposal, these inferences are underwritten by a structural similarity between syntactic and semantic representations: learners expect that the number of clause arguments exactly matches the number of participant roles in the event concept under which its referent is viewed. We argue against this proposal, and in favor of a theory rooted in syntactic and semantic contents— in mappings from syntactic positions to thematic relations. We (i) provide evidence that infants view certain scenes under a concept with three participant relations (a girl taking a truck from a boy), and (ii) show that toddlers do not expect these representations to align numerically with clauses used to describe those scenes: they readily accept two-argument descriptions ("she pimmed the truck!"). This argues against syntactic bootstrapping theories underwritten by mappings between structural features of syntactic and semantic representations. Instead, our findings support bootstrapping based on grammatical and thematic content. Children’s earliest inferences may rely on the assumption that the syntactic asymmetry between subject and object correlates with a difference in how their referents relate to the event described by the sentence. </p>

						</summary>
    						<p> This paper discusses differences between <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> with regard to (a) pair-list readings; (b) subject/object asymmetries seen with <i>every</i> but not with <i>each</i>; and (c) the long-held intuition that <i>each</i> is more individualistic whereas <i>every</i> is friendlier to groups. We propose that these phenomena can be captured by prior accounts of the Mandarin Chinese distributive universal quantifier <i>mei</i>. In particular, we consider the Double Variable Hypothesis (the idea that in DUQ, for every x, there must be a y) (S.-Z. Huang 1995; 1996), and the Skolemized Topicality Hypothesis (the idea that topical quantifiers are Skolemized, resulting in the required x-y pairings) (S.-Z. Huang 2022b). We argue that (a’) pair-list answers to questions with quantifiers are derivable from the Double Variable Hypothesis; (b’) the subject/object asymmetry seen in <i>every</i> is due to its positionally-varied association with the Double Variable Hypothesis, while <i>each</i> is always subject to Skolemized Topicality due to its inherent topicality; and (c’) the individualistic interpretation of <i>each</i> can be described as stemming from its intrinsically Skolemized topicality as well. </p>

						</summary>
    						<p> It’s long been observed that <i>each</i> and <i>every</i>, while both distributive universal quantifiers, differ in subtle ways. One recent proposal, outlined in Knowlton (2021), seeks to explain these differences by positing a semantic distinction: the mental representation that serves as the meaning of <i>every</i> has a semantic constituent that calls for grouping the things quantified over as a plurality; the representation that serves as the meaning of <i>each</i> lacks any such piece. A natural prediction of this view is that <i>every NP</i> should implicitly make available a plurality corresponding to "the NPs" in a way that <i>each NP</i> does not. We test this prediction in two forced choice judgment experiments, both involving sentence-internal elements that require anaphora to a plurality. As predicted, <i>every NP</i> is better able to provide the necessary plural comparison class to predicates involving <i>same</i>, and to serve as the antecedent of plural <i>they</i>. </p>

						</summary>
							<p> The mind represents abstract magnitude information, including time, space, and number, but in what format is this information stored? We show support for the bipartite format of perceptual magnitudes, in which the measured value on a dimension is scaled to the dynamic range of the input, leading to a privileged status for values at the lowest and highest end of the range. In six experiments with college undergraduates, we show that observers are faster and more accurate to find the endpoints (i.e., the minimum and maximum) than any of the inner values, even as the number of items increases beyond visual short-term memory limits. Our results show that length, size, and number are represented in a dynamic format that allows for comparison-free sorting, with endpoints represented with an immediately accessible status, consistent with the bipartite model of perceptual magnitudes. We discuss the implications for theories of visual search and ensemble perception. </p>

							<i>Individuals versus ensembles and “each” versus “every”: linguistic framing affects performance in a change detection task</i></a>. 
							Glossa Psycholinguistics.&nbsp 
							<a href="pdfs/papers/KHPL2023.pdf" class="icon fa fa-file-pdf-o"></a>&nbsp
						</summary>
							<p> Though <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> are both distributive universal quantifiers, a common theme in linguistic and psycholinguistic investigations into them has been that <i>each</i> is somehow more individualistic than <i>every</i>. We offer a novel explanation for this generalization: <i>each</i> has a first-order meaning which serves as an internalized instruction to cognition to build a thought that calls for representing the (restricted) domain as a series of individuals; by contrast, <i>every</i> has a second-order meaning which serves as an instruction to build a thought that calls for grouping the domain. In support of this view, we show that these distinct meanings invite the use of distinct verification strategies, using a novel paradigm. In two experiments, participants who had been asked to verify sentences like <i>each/every circle is green</i> were subsequently given a change detection task. Those who evaluated <i>each</i>-sentences were better able to detect the change, suggesting they encoded the individual circles' colors to a greater degree. Taken together with past work demonstrating that participants recall group properties after evaluating sentences with <i>every</i> better than after evaluating sentences with <i>each</i>, these results support the hypothesis that <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> call for treating the individuals that constitute their domain differently: as independent individuals (<i>each</i>) or as members of an ensemble collection (<i>every</i>). We situate our findings within a conception of linguistic meanings as instructions for thought building, on which the format of the resulting thought has consequences for how meanings interface with non-linguistic cognition. </p>

							<i>Psycholinguistic evidence for restricted quantification</i></a>. 
							Natural Language Semantics.&nbsp
							<a href="pdfs/papers/KPWHL2023.pdf" class="icon fa-file-pdf-o"></a>&nbsp
						</summary>
							<p> Quantificational determiners are often said to be devices for expressing relations. For example, the meaning of <i>every</i> is standardly described as the inclusion relation, with a sentence like <i>every frog is green</i> meaning roughly that the green things include the frogs. Here, we consider an older, non-relational alternative: determiners are tools for creating restricted quantifiers. On this view, determiners specify how many elements of a restricted domain (e.g., the frogs) satisfy a given condition (e.g., being green). One important difference concerns how the determiner treats its two grammatical arguments. On the relational view, the arguments are on a logical par as independent terms that specify the two relata. But on the restricted view, the arguments play distinct logical roles: specifying the limited domain versus supplying an additional condition on domain entities. We present psycholinguistic evidence suggesting that the restricted view better describes what speakers know when they know the meaning of a determiner. In particular, we find that when asked to evaluate sentences of the form <i>every F is G</i>, participants mentally group the Fs but not the Gs. Moreover, participants forego representing the group defined by the intersection of F and G. This tells against the idea that speakers understand <i>every F is G</i> as implying that the Fs bear relation (e.g., inclusion) to a second group. </p>

							Cognitive Psychology.&nbsp 
							<a href="pdfs/papers/KTP2023.pdf" class="icon fa fa-file-pdf-o"></a>&nbsp 
						</summary>
							<p> A complete theory of the meaning of linguistic expressions needs to explain their semantic properties, their links to non-linguistic cognition, and their use in communication. Even though in principle interconnected, these areas are generally not pursued in tandem. We present a novel take on the semantics-cognition-pragmatics interface. We propose that formal semantic differences in expressions’ meanings lead those meanings to activate distinct cognitive systems, which in turn have downstream effects on when speakers prefer to use those expressions. As a case study, we focus on the quantifiers "each" and "every", which can be used to talk about the same state of the world, but have been argued to differ in meaning. In particular, we adopt a mentalistic proposal about these quantifiers on which "each" has a purely individualistic meaning that interfaces with the psychological system for representing object-files, whereas "every" has a meaning that implicates a group and interfaces with the psychological system for representing ensembles. In seven experiments, we demonstrate that this account correctly predicts both known and newly-observed constraints on how "each" and "every" are pragmatically used. More generally, this integrated approach to semantics, cognition, and pragmatics suggests that canonical patterns of language use can be affected in predictable ways by fine-grained differences in semantic meanings and the cognitive systems to which those meanings connect. </p>

						</summary>
							<p> Objects can either be represented as independent individuals ("object-files") or as members of a collection (an "ensemble"). Work over the past 40 years has explored these representational systems, largely in the visual domain. Far less is known about auditory objects. Here, we show that a property characteristic of visual object representation – that it can be modulated by linguistic framing – also applies to auditory objects. In particular, we show that using the expression "each sound" versus "every sound" can bias auditory object construal in the same way that using "each circle" versus "every circle" can bias visual object construal. These findings support the idea that object-files and ensembles are not limited to the visual domain, but are representational formats found more generally throughout cognition. </p>

							<p> "Each" and "every" can be used to express the same truth-conditions but differ in their contexts of use.

In five experiments (n=798 total) we demonstrate that this mentalistic account correctly predicts newly-observed constraints on how "each" and "every" are pragmatically used. More generally, these results demonstrate that canonical patterns of language use are affected in predictable ways by fine-grained differences in semantic representations and the cognitive systems to which those representations connect. By treating the output of semantics as mental representations that are more finely articulated than truth-conditions -- and by taking seriously the relationship between linguistic meanings and non-linguistic cognitive systems -- we can explain otherwise puzzling patterns of language use. </p>

						</summary>
							<p> The universal quantifier <i>each</i> is more strongly distributive than its counterparts <i>every</i> and <i>all</i>. It forces predicates to apply to individuals, it more often supports pair-list readings, it’s unfriendly to genericity, and, in psycholinguistic tasks, it encourages encoding and remembering individual properties. But what information leads learners to acquire this aspect of <i>each</i>’s meaning? We explore the hypothesis that, because of its meaning, parents are more likely to use <i>each</i> in situations that independently promote representing the domain of quantification as a series of individuals (as opposed to a group). In line with this, we find that in child-directed speech, parents often use <i>each</i> to quantify over small numbers of physically present things. The same cannot be said of <i>every</i> and <i>all</i>. Because such situations are independently known to trigger object-files – the mind’s system for representing individuals – we argue that these cases are ideal for acquiring the individualistic aspect of <i>each</i>. </p>

							<p> A sentence like <i>every circle is blue</i> might be understood in terms of individuals and their properties (e.g., for each thing that is a circle, it is blue) or in terms of a relation between groups (e.g., the blue things include the circles). Relatedly, theorists can specify the contents of universally quantified sentences in first-order or second-order terms. We offer new evidence that this logical first-order vs. second-order distinction corresponds to a psychologically robust individual vs. group distinction that has behavioral repercussions. Participants were shown displays of dots and asked to evaluate sentences with <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, or <i>all</i> combined with a predicate (e.g., <i>big dot</i>). We find that participants are better at estimating how many things the predicate applied to after evaluating sentences in which universal quantification is indicated with <i>every</i> or <i>all</i>, as opposed to <i>each</i>. We argue that <i>every</i> and <i>all</i> are understood in second-order terms that encourage group representation, while <i>each</i> is understood in first-order terms that encourage individual representation. Since the sentences that participants evaluate are truth-conditionally equivalent, our results also bear on questions concerning how meanings are related to truth-conditions.

							<p> Natural languages like English connect pronunciations with meanings. Linguistic pronunciations can be described in ways that relate them to our motor system (e.g., to the movement of our lips and tongue). But how do linguistic meanings relate to our nonlinguistic cognitive systems? As a case study, we defend an explicit proposal about the meaning of <i>most</i> by comparing it to the closely related <i>more</i>: whereas <i>more</i> expresses a comparison between two independent subsets, <i>most</i> expresses a subset–superset comparison. Six experiments with adults and children demonstrate that these subtle differences between their meanings influence how participants organize and interrogate their visual world. In otherwise identical situations, changing the word from <i>most</i> to <i>more</i> affects preferences for picture–sentence matching (experiments 1–2), scene creation (experiments 3–4), memory for visual features (experiment 5), and accuracy on speeded truth judgments (experiment 6). These effects support the idea that the meanings of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> are mental representations that provide detailed instructions to conceptual systems.

							<p> Quantificational determiners have meanings that are "conservative" in the following sense: in sentences, repeating a determiner's internal argument within its external argument is logically insignificant. Using a verification task to probe which sets (or properties) of entities are represented when participants evaluate sentences, we test the predictions of three potential explanations for the cross-linguistic yet substantive conservativity constraint. According to "lexical restriction" views, words like <i>every</i> express relations that are exhibited by pairs of sets, but only some of these relations can be expressed with determiners. An "interface filtering" view retains the relational conception of determiner meanings, while replacing appeal to lexical filters (on relations of the relevant type) with special rules for interpreting the combination of a quantificational expression (Det NP) with its syntactic context and a ban on meanings that lead to triviality. The contrasting idea of "ordered predication" is that determiners don't express genuine relations. Instead, the second argument provides the scope of a monadic quantifier, while the first argument selects the domain for that quantifier: the sequences with respect to which it is evaluated. On this view, a determiner's two arguments each have a different logical status, suggesting that they might have a different psychological status as well. We find evidence that this is the case: When evaluating sentences like <i>every big circle is blue</i>, participants mentally group the things specified by the determiner's first argument (e.g., the big circles) but not the things specified by the second argument (e.g., the blue things) or the intersection of both (e.g., the big blue circles). These results suggest that the phenomenon of conservativity is due to ordered predication. </p>

							<p> A universally quantified sentence like <i>every frog is green</i> is standardly thought to express a two-place second-order relation (e.g., the set of frogs is a subset of the set of green things). This dissertation argues that as a psychological hypothesis about how speakers mentally represent universal quantifiers, this view is wrong in two respects. First, <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, and <i>all</i> are not represented as two-place relations, but as one-place descriptions of how a predicate applies to a restricted domain (e.g., relative to the frogs, everything is green). Second, while <i>every</i> and <i>all</i> are represented in a second-order way that implicates a group, <i>each</i> is represented in a completely first-order way that does not involve grouping the satisfiers of a predicate together (e.g., relative to individual frogs, each one is green). These "psycho-logical" distinctions have consequences for how participants evaluate sentences like <i>every circle is green</i> in controlled settings. In particular, participants represent the extension of the determiner’s internal argument (the circles), but not the extension of its external argument (the green things). Moreover, the cognitive system they use to represent the internal argument differs depending on the determiner: Given <i>every</i> or <i>all</i>, participants show signatures of forming ensemble representations, but given <i>each</i>, they represent individual object-files. In addition to psychosemantic evidence, the proposed representations provide explanations for at least two semantic phenomena. The first is the "conservativity" universal: All determiners allow for duplicating their first argument in their second argument without a change in informational significance (e.g., <i>every fish swims</i> has the same truth-conditions as <i>every fish is a fish that swims</i>). This is a puzzling generalization if determiners express two-place relations, but it is a logical consequence if they are devices for forming one-place restricted quantifiers. The second is that <i>every</i>, but not <i>each</i>, naturally invites certain kinds of generic interpretations (e.g., <i>gravity acts on every/#each object</i>). This asymmetry can potentially be explained by details of the interfacing cognitive systems (ensemble and object-file representations). And given that the difference leads to lower-level concomitants in child-ambient speech (as revealed by a corpus investigation), children may be able to leverage it to acquire <i>every</i>’s second-order meaning. This case study on the universal quantifiers suggests that knowing the meaning of a word like <i>every</i> consists not just in understanding the informational contribution that it makes, but in representing that contribution in a particular format. And much like phonological representations provide instructions to the motor planning system, it supports the idea that meaning representations provide (sometimes surprisingly precise) instructions to conceptual systems. </p>
